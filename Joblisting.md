This is something straightforward we need. I have even seen the code on ChatGPT, but I don't have all the skills to implement it.

Hello, we want to develop a simple real-time website tracking system that captures visitor data and UTM parameters.

Scope of Work:

## Develop a client-side script (JavaScript) to capture:

Current URL
Referrer URL
User agent
UTM parameters (utm_source, utm_medium, etc.)
Timestamp of visit


Develop a server-side script (preferably using Node.js & Express.js) to:

Receive and store the data sent from the client-side script
Provide an endpoint to retrieve the stored data in real-time for dashboard viewing
Implement a basic dashboard view (can be simple HTML/CSS):

Real-time display of incoming visitor data
Polls the server for updates at regular intervals (e.g., every few seconds)
Shows visitor details and UTM parameters
Additional Requirements:

The solution should be scalable and consider performance for high traffic websites.
Must implement basic security measures to prevent data manipulation or injection.
The system should be GDPR compliant, so considerations for data privacy and storage are essential.
(Optional) Implement WebSocket or a similar technology for real-time push instead of polling.
Deliverables:

Complete source code for client-side and server-side scripts.
Documentation on how to integrate and deploy the system.
A working demo of the real-time dashboard.
To be a best fit for this project, you need:

Prior experience with real-time web technologies.
Knowledge of UTM parameters and their use cases.
Good understanding of data security and GDPR requirements.
Strong communication skills and a proactive approach to problem-solving.
When applying, please provide examples of similar projects you've worked on in the past.
